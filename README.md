# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: nested routes failing to render correctly.  The problem arises when the `<Routes>` component is nested within another component, resulting in a blank page instead of the expected content.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides a working solution.

## Problem

The original code uses nested routes within a functional component. The routes are defined correctly, but the app does not render any of the route components.  This is because of incorrect usage of the component. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `<BrowserRouter>` component wraps the entire application to provide the necessary routing context.  The solution shows the correct way to set up routing for a React application, enabling the components to render correctly.
